        <p class="lead">This is my developer site which contains my recent projects. I'm very interested in coding and electronics, so I love to combine these two. You'll see mostly Arduino or ESP based projects, but I'll post my Java and C# projects, too. Every post is connected to my github page, so you can get source codes and stuff as well.</p>
        <p class="lead">Have fun! ðŸ™‚</p>
